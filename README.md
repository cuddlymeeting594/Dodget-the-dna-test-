# Dodget-the-dna-test-
Silly game about pavros

Download this and simply run the .exe file named dodge_the_dna_test

If you delete any of the assets the game won't be able to run, you can however change them to other stuff as long as the filename and image type (jpg, png etc) is the same as the previous one.

If you wish you can delete the .py file, which is just the code and is not necessary for you to run the game
